title: Brief Narrative Video for Multimedia Class
---

A group project I was a part of for my Fall 2019 Multimedia class was the creation of a brief narrative video. The goals of this were to practice scripting, storyboarding, and the basics of video production. I was in charge of the storyboarding and direction of the video.

The result of our work was a brief, silly video that can be seen below.
