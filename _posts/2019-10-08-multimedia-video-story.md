title: Brief Narrative Video for Multimedia Class
---

A group project I was a part of for my Fall 2019 Multimedia class was the creation of a brief narrative video. The goals of this were to practice scripting, storyboarding, and the basics of video production. 

I was in charge of the storyboarding, direction, and editing of the video. I used Adobe Premiere to edit the project. By the end of the project, I learned about storyboarding, directing, and I gained additional video editing experience.

The result of our work was a brief, silly video that can be seen below.
