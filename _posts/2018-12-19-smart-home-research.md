title: Voice-Activated Technology Accessibility Research
---

Working with two other group members and the staff of the Accessible Information and Communication Technologies (AICT) at Gallaudet University, our team performed preliminary research into methods of making voice-activated technologies (such as Amazon's Alexa) more accessible for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing users.

This project was a part of the National Science Foundation's "Research Experience for Undergraduates". After applying for the program the winter before, I was interviewed and accepted to help conduct the research into accessible technologies.

Once I was accepted to the program, I was flown to Washington, DC for 10 weeks during the summer to stay on Gallaudet University's campus and work with professors and fellow undergraduate researchers to work on research for accessible technologies. 

During my time in DC, and throughout the research, I enjoyed the many opportunities for getting involved in the Deaf community in the area. I learned a great deal about American Sign Language and the people that use it, made several good friends, and worked alongside many new researchers and professors.
