title: Web Development Work - Blue Bird Summer Internship 2019
---

During my summer internship at Blue Bird, one of my largest projects was to develop a new section of the website for the training division, Blue Bird Academy.

This project was developed in co-operation with the Blue Bird Academy team. I was able to develop, get their feedback, and quickly update the website with the feedback they provided.

The software I used included Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Oxcyon's Centralpoint. I used my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and web management to create the website sections shown below.

As of late 2019, this project is still ongoing. I am currently working for Blue Bird part-time, and continuing to update and improve Blue Bird Academy's online presence.
