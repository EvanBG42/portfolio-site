title: Brochure Design for the Chess Empowerment Association of Middle Georgia 
---

The final project for my Document and Web Design class at Mercer University was to find a group or organization in need of some design work to create some material for to help them. I chose the local youth chess organization due to their involvement in the community around campus, and created a brochure that could advertise primarily to parents.

I began the project by getting in touch with Shawn Shivdat from the Chess Empowerment Association (CEA) via email. I requested information about what he believed was most important for parents to know, as well as access to some of the assets (such as the logo and promotional images) for use in the brochure.

After a few revisions and test designs, I completed the brochure. It's intended to be printed on double-sided glossy paper and folded in thirds to produce a trifold brochure.

I don't believe they ever chose to use the brochure, but I'm happy with how it turned out and I look forward to future design work.
