title: Analysis of Mercer University's Pre-Medical Canvas Course 
---

As a project for my Instructional Design class at Mercer University, our group was tasked with analyzing and recommending changes to the school's pre-medical track that was recently changed to an online course on Canvas.

Our group was presented with the project after roughly a month and a half of instruction about theory and practice of adult instruction. 

The advisor for all students on Mercer's pre-medical track approached our class because she had recently moved the content from a print manual to an online course, and was looking for assistance making the online course as useful for the students as possible.

The majority of our time was spent analyzing the content and objectives of the course in order to determine how effective it is at achieving those goals. We interviewed the academic advisor for the course and a number of pre-medical students to find their goals and thoughts about the course. We then looked at the content and organization of the course in order to determine how effective it was at achieving those goals.

Following our analysis, we wrote our recommendations report for how to make the course more effective. Our largest recommendation was a more structured organization, with regular reminders to the student about what to do during each semester. 

The pre-medical advisor received our recommendations with great enthusiasm, and actually started implementing some of the changes the very same day! I believe I learned a lot about online instruction and course analysis with this project, and I'm glad to have been given such an incredible opportunity.
