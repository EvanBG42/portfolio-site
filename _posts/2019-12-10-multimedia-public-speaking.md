title: Interactive Foundations for Public Speaking - Multimedia Project for Georgia Military College
---

The final project for my Multimedia class at Mercer University was a project commissioned by a professor at Georgia Military College. The goal of the project was to develop multimedia e-learning modules that would help students entering a public speaking class.

This project was lead by a graduate student manager and the group consisted of me and two other students. Together, we wrote, developed, and tested the modules. We primarily used Adobe Captivate to create the modules.

My involvement in the project was focused on the following areas:
	- Writer (Citations Module)
	- Voice Over / Audio Recording
	- Developer (Citations Module)
	- Tester & Technical Support
