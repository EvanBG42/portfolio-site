title: Fictional Audio Ad for Multimedia Class
---

One project for my multimedia class during my Fall 2019 semester was to write and record an audio ad. I chose to record an ad for a fictional company that sells carnival-style junk food. The goal was to create something that could realistically be played on the radio.

This was recorded and edited using Adobe Audition. In doing this project, I gained experience in the world of script writing, audio recording, and audio editing.
