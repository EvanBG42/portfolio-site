I'm Evan Gambill, a student at Mercer University in Macon, GA currently studying Technical Communication and Computer Science. I graduated from Colquitt County High School in Moultrie, GA in 2016.
<br><br>
I've got a passion for technology and communication in all their aspects. I especially have an interest in developing assistive and accessible technologies.
<br><br>
My hobbies include programming, building computers, playing and designing video and board games, writing, and performing music. In high school, I was a member of three different choirs and had the opportunity to perform in two musicals.

I've recently taken up running, and I look forward to where that will take me.
