I'm Evan Gambill, a student at Mercer University currently studying Technical Communication and Computer Science.

I've got a passion for technology and communication in all their aspects. Especially a fan of assistive and accessible technologies.

Hobbies include programming, building computers, playing and designing video and board games, and writing about all of these and more.
